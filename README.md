# SOLID (object-oriented design)

This repository contains examples of the five SOLID design principles of object-oriented programming. The examples are written in Java. 
Each example has a positive and negative version to demonstrate adherence to and violation of the principle, respectively.

In object-oriented computer programming, the term [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make 
software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. 
The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by [Robert C. Martin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)
Though they apply to any object-oriented design, the SOLID principles can also form a core philosophy for methodologies 
such as agile development or adaptive software development. The SOLID acronym was introduced by Michael Feathers.

### Concepts
- **Single Responsibility Principle**  
    _a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)._
- Open/Closed Principle  
    _software entities â€¦ should be open for extension, but closed for modification._
- Liskov Substitution Principle  
    objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also [design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract).
- Interface Segregation Principle  
    many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
- Dependency Inversion Principle  
    one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
